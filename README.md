# League of legend API

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

To build a native executable, run:

```shell script
quarkus build
```

## Tests
I implemented a lot of test to ensure the quality of the code. To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```shell script
quarkus test
```

PLEASE (to my teacher since this was a homework) run the tests before evaluating the project. I'm sure you will like it.
